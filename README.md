# k-means with Three different Distance Metrics and Dimension Reduction 
We will apply manually dimension reduction to Iris data instead of using sklearn in python or R library and compare three different Distance Metrics.
The power of k-means algorithm is due to its computational efficiency and the nature of ease at which it can be used.
Distance metrics are used to find similar data objects that lead to develop robust algorithms for the data mining functionalities such as classification and clustering.
